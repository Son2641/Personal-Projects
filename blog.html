          <h2>The Sacrifices and Rewards of a Dota 2 Hard Support</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Jason and I created this blog as my friend from Batch 13 inspired me to create a hard support role version of his blog.</p>
          <p>Dota 2 is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that requires a team of players to work together to achieve victory. One crucial role in Dota 2 is the hard support. In this blog, we will explore the hard support role in Dota 2, its importance, and the skills required to excel in this role and on how to play this role effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="first-part">
          <h3>What are hard supports in Dota 2?</h3>
          <p>First of all, what is a hard support? In Dota 2, the hard support is typically the player on the team who has the least amount of farm and focuses on providing vision, setting up kills, and protecting the carry player. The hard support's job is to make sure that their carry has a good start to the game and can farm safely without being harassed by the enemy team.</p>
          <p>A teammate of mine said this before "For every fat carry, there needs to be an equally skinny support". There is so only so much farm to go around, so somebody on the team needs to be selfless and go without, so that another hero can maximise.</p>
          <p>Any highly skilled carry player will admit that their support player(s) as well as their own play nearly always contribute to their success. Supports provide the environment necessary for carriers to thrive.</p>
          <h3>What is the importance of this role?</h3>
          <p>So why is the hard support role so important? Well, a good hard support can make all the difference in a game. By providing vision with wards and controlling the map, the hard support can ensure that their team has the advantage in fights and can secure objectives like Roshan and towers. Additionally, a good hard support can make sure that their carry player has a strong early game, which can set them up for success in the late game.</p>
          <p>Pubbers don't particularly like the <strong>Hard Support</strong> role because you get very little farm, are frequently underleveled, and are expected to be the sacrificial lamb. Yet you'll see that each and every professional team has one and even in high rank games. Why? Because they are an essential member of the team and a good one greatly increases your chances of success.</p>
          <p>It's odd because playing that role is actually incredibly satisfying. You must be able to function and survive while being significantly outmatched by practically every other player on the map. This requires knowledge and aptitude. It's like to beating a game on the hardest difficulty while everyone else is using the easy setting.</p>

          <h3>What are the essential skills needed to play this role?</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Map awareness: One of the most important skills for a hard support is having good map awareness. You need to be constantly scanning the map for enemy movements, making sure your carry is safe, and placing wards in strategic locations to give your team vision.
            </li>
            <li>Communication: Communication is key in Dota 2, especially as a hard support. You need to be constantly communicating with your team, letting them know when you're placing wards, when you need help, and when you're ready to initiate a fight.</li>
            <li>Ability to read the game: As a hard support, you need to have a good understanding of the game and be able to read the flow of the game. You need to know when to rotate to different lanes, when to push, and when to back off.</li>
            <li>Mechanical skill: Although hard supports don't typically farm as much as other roles, they still need to have good mechanical skills. You need to be able to land your spells, use your items effectively, and have good positioning in team fights.</li>
            <li>Patience and discipline: Hard supports need to be patient and disciplined. You can't afford to be reckless and die unnecessarily, as this will hurt your team's chances of winning. You need to be patient and wait for the right opportunities to initiate fights and make plays.</li>
            <li>Adaptability: Finally, good hard supports need to be adaptable. You need to be able to adjust your playstyle based on the heroes you're playing with and against. This may mean changing up your item builds or playstyle to better suit the situation.</li>
          </ol>
